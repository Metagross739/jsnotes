Java development toolkit.

it generally contians, tools and fucntions and predfeined classes. you need in you programs.

Also it has JRE, Java runtime environment. It has all the lbraries, that are responsible to compile and interpreate your code. 

Java compile converts the code into byte code. 

JVM actually excutes this byte code in its virtual environment.

JVM is java virtual Machine, solely responsible for, to run your class file. making it plafrom independt. it runs insided virtal machie.


JVM has certain functions

//class loader

it ususally loads the program in memory.

//class area:

It is also called as method area. Where it stores all the method names and its return types.

//Heap and stack memeory

usually, newly created objects are stored in a heap, where as temp values are stored in stack memory. where as refrence to object or, string are stored in stack.

// PC Register

It storees the information about current exceution instrucntions/context.


// Native method

It stores native method. native methods are, generally third party apis, written in different languages which we require in our java program.

In Java, the native stack (also known as the native method stack) stores information related to native methods. Native methods are methods written in other programming languages, such as C or C++, which are invoked from Java code using the Java Native Interface (JNI). These methods are often used to interact with system-level resources or third-party APIs that are not directly accessible from Java.

//native stack

load these native methods.

//Native method interface

It is resposible for, communicating with native method libray.
